Bank Customer Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of bank customer data, focusing on variables such as balance, deposit, age, loan status, and more. The primary objective of this analysis is to understand the significance of the relationship between these variables.
